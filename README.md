## Destiny Loadouts Project

This project was designed to let users upload and save their specific Destiny (the video game) loadouts. Users can create, read, update and delete their loadouts. Destiny does have an API that would be great to connect in the future so that users can see their own weapons. 

Formatting for CSS was done in Bootstrap. 

Please note that the project will continue to be refined!
